               Welcome to MSC Nastran 2022.4
  
   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions in several releases through the year. Key enhancements in
   Version 2022.4 are summarized below. Addtional details can be found in
   the MSC Nastran Version 2022.4 Release Guide.
  
  
     MSC Nastran 2022.4 Features and Enhancements
  
     eNVH
     - Superelement based Virtual SEA for high frequency acoustics with
       MSC Nastran-Actran co-simulation
     - AVL Excite interface improvements adding support for data recovery of
       multiple loadcases and time/frequency steps
     - Poroelastic material data encryption for MAT* type entities in the bulk
       data file to secure material characteristics
  
     Reduced Order Models (ROM) based parametric Smart Superelements
     - ROM-based superelements in MSC Nastran that leverage Odyssee reduced-order
       model technology
  
     Rotodynamics
     - SOL 128 robustness improvements for windmilling analysis with the addition
       of a smoothing function to improve convergence of the NLRGAP element
  
     Dynamics
     - Random response enhancements
       - Composite ply Failure Index (FI) is now computed from RMS stresses or
         strains
       - Composite Strength Ratio (SR) is now available in the HDF5 output file
       - Reduction of output with the support of PSD results exclusively in HDF5
         or OP2 removing unnecessary non-random output quantities
  
     HPC
     - Support for MUMPS BLR (Block Low-Rank) multifrontal factorization for
       improved efficiency and performance on large models
  
     Fatigue
     - Continued expansion of CAEfatigue analysis support including:
       - Multiaxial assessment (method=auto for SN materials)
       - Peak valley extraction
       - MMPDS mechanism for defining S-N curves for time domain
  
  
     Documentation
     - The complete documentation set is provided in a separate installer and
       when installed is available at: MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/pdf_nastran directory,
